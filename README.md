# Weather Prediction README

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting whether it will rain tomorrow based on various weather features. The code provided in this repository implements different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to predict the target variable. The performance of each algorithm is compared to identify the most accurate prediction model.

## Libraries and Packages
The following libraries and packages are used in the code:
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization
- Plotly: Interactive visualizations
- scikit-learn: Machine learning library
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting framework

Please make sure to install the required packages using the appropriate package manager.

## Code Explanation
1. Dataset loading: The code loads the weather dataset using Pandas and performs initial data exploration to understand the data.

2. Data preprocessing: Missing values are visualized using the missingno library, and numerical features are preprocessed by filling missing values with the mean and removing outliers using the IQR method. Categorical columns are encoded using LabelEncoder.

3. Data splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

4. Model implementation and evaluation: Different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors are implemented and trained on the training set. The models are then evaluated on the testing set using accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

5. Performance comparison: The performance of each algorithm is compared, and the most accurate prediction model is identified based on the evaluation metrics.

Please refer to the code for more detailed explanations and implementation details.

## Results
The performance of each machine learning algorithm on the testing set is as follows:

- Logistic Regression: Accuracy = XX%, Classification Report = ...
- Decision Tree: Accuracy = XX%, Classification Report = ...
- Random Forest: Accuracy = XX%, Classification Report = ...
- XGBoost: Accuracy = XX%, Classification Report = ...
- K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy = XX%, Classification Report = ...

Based on the performance results, the most accurate prediction model is identified.

Please note that the provided code may require further adjustments and improvements depending on the specific requirements of your project.
